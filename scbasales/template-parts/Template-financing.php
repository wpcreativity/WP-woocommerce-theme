                    <h3>Baystone financial group</h3>
                    <P>Founded in 1987 as a division of kansas state bank, baystone financial group is one of the largest municipal finance teams in the country. We support the work of thousands of independent and municipal fire departments throughout the united states</P>

                    <p>Our respect for the value of our clients’ work pushes us to be prompt, accurate, and straightforward in everything we do. Our job is to develop long-term relationships to protect and serve their communities year after year.</p>

                    <h3>How we serve</h3>
                    
                    <p>Our specialty is lease purchase financing, which allows fire departments to buy essential equipment through manageable installment payments</p>
                    
                    <p>At baystone, you can count on customized financing solutions, quotes within 24 hours, in-house legal advice, and no closing costs or hidden fees. We are even a pre-approved lender for numerous government and nonprofit buying cooperatives</p>
                    
                    <p>At baystone, we work closely with independent departments to navigate the ins and outs of financing on smaller budgets. We also help municipal departments get quick funding and larger deals.</p>

                    <h3>Lease purchase financing</h3>
                    
                    <p>Lease purchase financing (lpf) with baystone allows fire departments to purchase vital equipment and property through installment lease payments, with no large, up-front cash outlays. As payments are made, the department – which maintains ownership of the equipment – builds equity in it’s investment. And lpf is not considered debt for municipalities, meaning only the current year’s lease payment is included in the operating budget</p>
                    
                    <p>Unlike captive lending programs, baystone finances both new and used equipment, from any manufacturer. We also consolidate or refinance debt, and offer combined purchasing. From big-ticket items such as trucks and stations, to essential smaller purchases like turnout gear and air packs, we get our clients what they need.</p>

                    <h3>Simple funding program</h3>
                    
                    <p>With our industry-leading simple funding program, we have made the lease purchase financing process quick and uncomplicated.</p>
                    
                    <p>For equipment or property that costs less than $500,000, clients simply complete a one-page credit application and submit one year of financial history. That’s it. Once credit approval is received, we prepare the contract with no legal opinion required, saving both time and money</p>
